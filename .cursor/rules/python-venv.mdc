# Python Virtual Environment

To avoid `ModuleNotFoundError` and other dependency issues, always use the Python interpreter from the project's virtual environment (`venv`).

**Running Scripts:**
Use the full path to the `python` executable within the `venv`:

```bash
/Users/mikil/Desktop/Desktop - Mikil’s MacBook Pro/SideProjects/Effective-LLM-Context-Length/venv/bin/python run_gemini_script.py
```

**Installing Packages:**
Use the `pip` module with the `venv`'s Python interpreter:

```bash
/Users/mikil/Desktop/Desktop - Mikil’s MacBook Pro/SideProjects/Effective-LLM-Context-Length/venv/bin/python -m pip install <package_name>
```

**DO NOT** use global `python`, `python3`, or `pip` commands directly as they are not linked to this project's isolated environment.
